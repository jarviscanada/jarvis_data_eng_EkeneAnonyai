# Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent## Introduction(about 150-200 words)Discuss the design of the project. What does this project/product do? Who are the users? What are the technolgoies you have used? (e.g. bash, docker, git, etc..)## Quick StartUse markdown code block for your quick start commands- Start a psql instance using psql_docker.sh```bash./scripts/psql_docker.sh create [db_username] [db_password]```- Create tables using ddl.sql```bashpsql -h psql_host -U db_username -d host_agent -f sql/ddl.sql```- Insert hardware specs data into the db using host_info.sh```./scripts/host_info.sh [psql host] [port] host_agent [db_username] [db_password]```  - Insert hardware usage data into the db using host_usage.sh```./scripts/host_usage.sh psql_host psql_port host_agent db_username db_password```  - Crontab setup## ImplemenationDiscuss how you implement the project.### ArchitectureDraw a cluster diagram with three Linux hosts, a DB, and agents (use draw.io website). Image must be saved to `assets` directory.### ScriptsShell script descirption and usage (use markdown code block for script usage)- psql_docker.sh- host_info.sh- host_usage.sh- crontab- queries.sql (describe what business problem you are trying to resolve)### Database ModelingDescribe the schema of each table using markdown table syntax (do not put any sql code)- `host_info`- `host_usage`## TestHow did you test your bash scripts and SQL queries? What was the result?## ImprovementsWrite at least three things you want to improvee.g.- handle hardware update- blah- blah
