# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent graduate from the Univeristy of Manitoba with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.
  I chose to study Computer Science a few years ago because I was fascinated by technology. In high school, I was taught
  about computers by a teacher who solidified my love for technology and made me even more certain that I had made the
  right choice with my major. I am very passionate about solving problems with technology and learning new technologies.
  Since I joined Jarvis as a Data Engineer trainee, I have worked on different projects utilizing Java 8, Maven,
  Linux/Bash, Git, Docker, RDBMS/ SQL and Springboot. I am very excited for more opportunities to learn and grow,
  while contributing meaningfully in the industry.

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that used bash scripts to deploy PostgreSQL database with
    Docker. Wrote SQL queries to insert Linux server hardware information into the database. Developed a bash agent
    program that automatically parses hardware specifications and real-time hard usage data, which is sent into
    the PostgreSQL database. It allows the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration team to track and manage a Linux cluster.

      - "Twitter App: Developed a Java application that allows users to create, fetch, and delete Tweets using the
      Twitter API. Designed the architecture of the app to carry out these operations on the Tweet object using MVC
      pattern and Java Spring framework. Implemented Restful APIs and ran unit and integration tests to them.
      Created a Dockerfile and deployed it to the Docker Hub."
      - "JDBC App: Developed a Java program that allows for data retrieval from a retail database pertaining to
      customers and their orders. The app allows for CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations to be implemented."
      - "Grep App: Implemented a Linux grep app in Java that searches every line in a file and outputs every line that
      matches the regex pattern. Optimized code by using Java Stream API and lambda. Deployed the program as a
      docker image to the DockerHub."
