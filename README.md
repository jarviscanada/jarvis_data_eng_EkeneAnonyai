# Ekene Anonyai . Jarvis Consulting

I am a recent graduate from the University of Manitoba with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I chose to study Computer Science a few years ago because I was fascinated by technology. Since joining Jarvis as a Data Engineer trainee, I have worked on different projects utilizing Java 8, Maven, Linux/Bash, Git, Docker, RDBMS/ SQL and Springboot.In high school, I was taught about computers by a teacher who solidified my love for technology and made me even more convinced that I had made the right choice with my major. I am very passionate about solving problems with technology and learning new technologies. I am very excited for more opportunities to learn and grow while contributing meaningfully to the industry.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_EkeneAnonyai](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_EkeneAnonyai)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_EkeneAnonyai/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent that used bash scripts to deploy PostgreSQL database with Docker. Wrote SQL queries to insert Linux server hardware information into the database. Developed a bash agent program that automatically parses hardware specifications and real-time hard usage data, which is sent into the PostgreSQL database. It allows the Jarvis Linux Cluster Administration team to track and manage a Linux cluster.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_EkeneAnonyai/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Developed a Java application that allows users to create, fetch, and delete Tweets using the Twitter API. Designed the architecture of the app to carry out these operations on the Tweet object using the MVC pattern and Java Spring framework. Implemented Restful APIs and ran unit and integration tests to them. Created a Dockerfile and deployed it to the Docker Hub.
  - JDBC App: Developed a Java program that allows for data retrieval from a retail database about customers and their orders. The app allows for CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) operations to be implemented
  - Grep App: Implemented a Linux grep app in Java that searches every line in a file and outputs every line that matches the regex pattern. Optimized code by using Java Stream API and lambda. For deployment, the program was dockerized into a docker image and deployed to the DockerHub for public access.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_EkeneAnonyai/tree/master/springboot)]: In Progress

## Highlighted Projects
**Android Marketplace/ Auction app**: Collaborated with a team of four other members to build a mobile marketplace/ auction app where users can buy, sell, track and own merchandise in a virtual space using Android studio and written in Java. Data from the app was stored in data stubs, controlled by the Persistence layer. Testing was done using integration testing and unit testing. Version control used was git, and projects were managed using GitLab.

**Course Registration Website**: Developed a simple frontend user interface for a course registration website alongside team members using HTML, CSS and JavaScript while keeping Human-Computer Interaction principles. The JavaScript library used was jQuery. Code was written in Sublime Text and run locally on the web. The website was created to make improvements to the university's course registration portal, 'Aurora'.

**Gallery Explorer**: Created a 3D hierarchical animation video game that modelled explorers in a gallery with observable exhibits. It included 3D collision checks and texture mapping that brings the gallery to life. The project was done in processing with the OpenGL API using Java. Included free-look feature that enables the explorer to look around their environment when the mouse is dragged across the screen.
